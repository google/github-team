Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p> <p>This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project Steward has a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.</p>"},{"location":"code-of-conduct.html#conflict-resolution","title":"Conflict Resolution","text":"<p>We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project\u2019s code of conduct.</p> <p>If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p> <p>Reports should be directed to [PROJECT STEWARD NAME(s) AND EMAIL(s)], the Project Steward(s) for [PROJECT NAME]. It is the Project Steward\u2019s duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then work with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source Programs Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you are uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Steward, please email opensource@google.com.</p> <p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.</p>"},{"location":"code-of-conduct.html#attribution","title":"Attribution","text":"<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/</p>"},{"location":"contributing.html","title":"How to Contribute","text":"<p>We would love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.</p>"},{"location":"contributing.html#before-you-begin","title":"Before you begin","text":""},{"location":"contributing.html#sign-our-contributor-license-agreement","title":"Sign our Contributor License Agreement","text":"<p>Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
